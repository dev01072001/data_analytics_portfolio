# Dev Sharma - Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a passionate aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. This repository showcases various projects that demonstrate my skills and abilities in transforming data into actionable insights.

## About Me

I hold a degree in B.Tech from College of Technology and Engineeering, Udaipur, Rajasthan and have developed a keen interest in data-driven decision-making. I am proficient in tools such as Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, and I enjoy tackling complex problems to find data-driven solutions.

## Projects

This portfolio includes the following projects:

1. **Fifa-19 Players-Data Analysis**
   Overview: This project focuses on analyzing the FIFA 19 players dataset to answer key questions related to player performance, demographics, and club affiliations. The dataset 
                   includes player attributes such as age, nationality, club, position, and skill ratings. Using SQL, I formulated and executed queries to extract insights, including 
                   identifying the top-rated players by position, analyzing age distribution among high-performing players, and exploring the correlation between player skills and their 
                   overall ratings. The findings reveal significant trends, such as the dominance of specific leagues in producing top-rated players and insights into how age impacts 
                   player potential. This analysis demonstrates the power of SQL in deriving meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
   
   **Technologies Used:** SQL, MS EXCEL
  
   **Key Findings:** This analysis addresses 15 specific questions regarding the FIFA 19 players dataset, with all queries and their results detailed in the attached SQL file in github 
                repository linked below. Below are a few key examples of the findings:
   Top Players: The highest-rated player is Lionel Messi, followed closely by Cristiano Ronaldo.
   
   Top 3 Nationalities by number of players:England, Germany, Spain
   
   Player having Highest wage:  The highest-waged player is Lionel Messi which is 565000.
   
   For a complete overview of the analysis, please refer to the SQL file for all questions and their detailed answers.

3. **Superstore Data Analysis using Tableau**
   **Overview:** This project involves analyzing superstore sales data to uncover crucial insights for business development. Using Tableau, I created dynamic visualization dashboards 
                   and stories that highlight key performance indicators, trends, and opportunities for growth. The analysis aims to support strategic decision-making processes within 
                   the organization.
     
  **Objectives:**
To visualize sales performance across various dimensions (e.g., region, product category, time).
To identify trends in customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
To highlight areas for improvement in sales and inventory management.
To facilitate data-driven decision-making for business development.

**Technologies Used:**
Tableau: For creating dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards.
Excel: For data cleaning and preparation (if applicable).
Data Source: Superstore sales dataset.

**Key Findings**
The analysis produced several key insights, including:

Sales Trends: Identified peak sales periods, showing a significant increase during holiday seasons.
Top Products: Determined the top-selling products and categories, indicating high demand items.
Regional Performance: Highlighted which regions generated the highest sales and which ones underperformed.
Customer Segmentation: Analyzed customer purchasing behavior, revealing distinct segments based on buying patterns.
Profit Margins: Assessed profit margins across different products and categories, identifying opportunities to increase profitability.

**Dashboard Features**
Sales Overview: A dashboard displaying total sales, profits, and order counts over time.
Regional Analysis: A map visualization illustrating sales distribution by region.
Product Performance: A breakdown of sales and profit by product category and sub-category.
Customer Insights: Visualizations that segment customers based on their purchasing habits.

**Challenges Faced**
Data Quality: Encountered issues with missing or inconsistent data, which required thorough cleaning and validation.
Complexity of Insights: Ensuring that visualizations communicated insights clearly to stakeholders was challenging but rewarding.
