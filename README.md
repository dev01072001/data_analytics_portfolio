# Dev Sharma - Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a passionate aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. This repository showcases various projects that demonstrate my skills and abilities in transforming data into actionable insights.

## About Me

I hold a degree in B.Tech from College of Technology and Engineeering, Udaipur, Rajasthan and have developed a keen interest in data-driven decision-making. I am proficient in tools such as Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, and I enjoy tackling complex problems to find data-driven solutions.

## Projects

This portfolio includes the following projects:

1. **Fifa-19 Players-Data Analysis**
   Overview: This project focuses on analyzing the FIFA 19 players dataset to answer key questions related to player performance, demographics, and club affiliations. The dataset 
                   includes player attributes such as age, nationality, club, position, and skill ratings. Using SQL, I formulated and executed queries to extract insights, including 
                   identifying the top-rated players by position, analyzing age distribution among high-performing players, and exploring the correlation between player skills and their 
                   overall ratings. The findings reveal significant trends, such as the dominance of specific leagues in producing top-rated players and insights into how age impacts 
                   player potential. This analysis demonstrates the power of SQL in deriving meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
   
   **Technologies Used:** SQL, MS EXCEL
  
   **Key Findings:** This analysis addresses 15 specific questions regarding the FIFA 19 players dataset, with all queries and their results detailed in the attached SQL file in github 
                repository linked below. Below are a few key examples of the findings:
   Top Players: The highest-rated player is Lionel Messi, followed closely by Cristiano Ronaldo.
