## About Me

I hold a degree in B.Tech from College of Technology and Engineeering, Udaipur, Rajasthan and have developed a keen interest in data-driven decision-making. I am proficient in tools such as Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, and I enjoy tackling complex problems to find data-driven solutions.

## Projects

This portfolio includes the following projects:

1. **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis using Python**
Overview: This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to extract meaningful insights regarding viewing trends, genre popularity, and release patterns. Using Python and its data analysis libraries, I created visualizations to illustrate key performance indicators and trends, supporting data-driven decision-making in the entertainment sector.

**Objectives:**

To identify and remove any duplicate records in the dataset.
To check for null values in any column and visualize the findings with a heatmap.
To explore specific titles, such as determining the Show ID and director for "House of Cards."
To analyze the year with the highest number of releases and present the findings with a bar graph.
To count the total number of movies and TV shows in the dataset, displaying the results visually.
To extract all movies released in the year 2000.
To compile a list of TV show titles released exclusively in India.
To identify the top 10 directors who contributed the most movies and TV shows to Netflix.
To filter records based on specific criteria, such as category and type.
To assess the number of appearances by Tom Cruise in the dataset.
To catalog the different ratings defined by Netflix and analyze specific rating metrics.
To investigate the maximum duration of any movie or show on Netflix.
To find out which country has the highest number of TV shows.
To demonstrate how to sort the dataset by release year.
To locate instances of specific categories and types within the dataset.

2. **Fifa-19 Players-Data Analysis**
   Overview: This project focuses on analyzing the FIFA 19 players dataset to answer key questions related to player performance, demographics, and club affiliations. The dataset 
                   includes player attributes such as age, nationality, club, position, and skill ratings. Using SQL, I formulated and executed queries to extract insights, including 
                   identifying the top-rated players by position, analyzing age distribution among high-performing players, and exploring the correlation between player skills and their 
                   overall ratings. The findings reveal significant trends, such as the dominance of specific leagues in producing top-rated players and insights into how age impacts 
                   player potential. This analysis demonstrates the power of SQL in deriving meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
   
   **Technologies Used:** SQL, MS EXCEL
  
   **Key Findings:** This analysis addresses 15 specific questions regarding the FIFA 19 players dataset, with all queries and their results detailed in the attached SQL file in github 
                repository linked below. Below are a few key examples of the findings:
   Top Players: The highest-rated player is Lionel Messi, followed closely by Cristiano Ronaldo.
   
   Top 3 Nationalities by number of players:England, Germany, Spain
   
   Player having Highest wage:  The highest-waged player is Lionel Messi which is 565000.
   
   For a complete overview of the analysis, please refer to the SQL file for all questions and their detailed answers.
